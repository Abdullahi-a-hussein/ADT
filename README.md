# Abstract Data Types (ADT)
This repo contains implementation of various Abstract Data types.  The language I use is Python 3. The following are included ADT to date:

<ul> 
   <li> <h2><a href="https://github.com/Abdullahi-a-hussein/ADT/blob/master/Stack/stack.py"> Stack</a> </h2></li>
   <p> This contains <b> LIFO </b> ADT with the following basic operational methods. 
   <ul>
      <li> Push method </li>
      <p> This appends new elements to the stack </p>
      <li> Pull method </li>
      <p> This removes and prints the top most item of the stack </p>
   </ul>
   This file also contains a **GuardedStack** child class of **Stack** where new stack elements is added to the stack if they pass the guard.
   </p>
</ul>
